    "The classical **FCI** (full configuration interaction) method, while provides exact solutions to time-independent, non-relativistic Schrödinger equation, is a numerical approach that considers all possible electron configurations within a given basis set, rather than providing an analytic solution. Only very small molecules can be simulated on classical computer.\n",

    "The **QPE** (quantum phase estimation) is the natural translation of the FCI procedure to quantum computers. It has exponential speedup but requires millions of qubits and quantum gates, so for real size problems only can be run on FTQC/LSQ machines. In practice, the speedup is polynomial, the exponential advantage for chemistry problems remains controversial.\n",

    "Today's quantum computers are **NISQ** (noisy intermediate-scale quantum) machines, we can only run short circuits and we use **VQE** (variational quantum eigensolver), a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm to approximate the value of the ground state energy."
